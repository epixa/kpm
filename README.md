# Kibana Plugin Manager

An API server and a CLI. Each are different projects with different
dependencies and requirements. They are in the same repo for the sake of
convenience.

## Current status: alpha

Both the CLI and server are currently in `alpha` status. This means that
neither are feature complete nor stable enough to rely on for real-world usage.

They each will be bumped to `beta` status when all core features are
implemented. At that point they would be stable enough to use in a
non-mission-critical setting.

## Where to start?

While in alpha, the best place to start is likely the
[contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).
